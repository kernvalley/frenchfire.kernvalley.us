Light northeast winds over the fire area will transport smoke southwesterly this morning before shifting around to the southwest, drifting smoke northeasterly, later in the day. Highest smoke impacts are again expected to remain near Sherman Pass, Kernville and Keeler where periods of unhealthy air quality are forecast midday with a daily average of Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups. Otherwise, smoke and haze will remain present in the region with Moderate air quality in Porterville and other areas further from the active fire. The potential for increased fire behavior and smoke production remains.
