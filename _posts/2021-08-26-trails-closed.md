Upper Kern River Area and Trails Closure Order issued due to the French Fire

As discussed during the Wednesday, August 25 virtual public meeting, Sequoia National Forest Supervisor Teresa Benson is issuing the Upper Kern River Area and Trails Forest Order No. 0513-21-26 to close an area 1,000 feet wide on each side of the Upper Kern River from the Riverkern Day Use area south of the Tulare/Kern County line and extending north for approximately 17 miles to the north side of the Johnsondale Bridge.
County Road Mountain 99 (M99), which runs along the upper Kern River and through this area closure, remains open, and serves as the main evacuation route in the event the French Fire changes direction and burns toward Kernville and the upper Kern Canyon.
The Upper Kern River Area and Trails Closure Order is needed to provide for public safety. The French Fire, south of this area, continues to exhibit extreme fire behavior due to dry fuel conditions, gusty winds, and short-range spot fires and is therefore very dangerous for the public. This wildfire could threaten human life, property, and resource values. The Order is effective from August 27 through September 13, 2021.
