> This is one team &mdash; One fight.

Up Alta Sierra, crews engaged in structure protection. Wind shifts at around 2:00 PM
cause spot fires and down-canyon winds drove the fire towards Wofford Heights.

Crews are improving containment lines and feeling optimistic about about holding the fire.

ReadyKern sends notifications when evacuation orders are lifted.

Groundwork on the investigation is complete and evidence is being analyzed.
The French Fire appears to be human caused and of a suspicious nature. Any tips for
the investigation may be sent to <a href="mailto:2021.french@firenet.gov" class="btn btn-primary">{% include common/icon.html icon="mail" height="16" width="16" fill="currentColor" %}2021.french@firenet.gov</a>

There is a planned closure of all recreational sites from Kernville to Johnsondale beginning
on 8/26.

The French Fire did impact the communities of Alta Sierra and Wofford Heights.
However, info on damages will not be released until after investigations.
