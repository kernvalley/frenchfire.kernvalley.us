 Please join us during the French Fire Facebook Live Event tonight for updates and information starting at 6 p.m., via the Sequoia National Forest and Kern County Fire Departmentsâ€™ Facebook sites. Please visit inciweb for more information: https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7813/.
The French Fire, started on August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, has now burned 14,773 acres with 15 percent containment. The fire is being managed by California Interagency Incident Management Team 12, coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management, Sequoia National Forest and Kern County Fire Department in Unified Command.
 On Sunday, Aug. 22, fire crews constructed a handline near Wagy Flat Road (Forest Road No. 25S02) to hold the fire and connect into a previous controlled line. Crews were also successful continuing handline from the Sawmill Road break to the division break that is one mile south of Wagy Flat. Today, crews will continue to mop up in those areas and pay close attention to the structures off the Sawmill Road.Further west, towards Rancheria Road (Forest Road No. 25S15), there was some fire growth and fire crews successfully used dozers and hand crews to catch the smaller spot fire slopped over onto Borderline Road. On Monday, crews will work towards Rancheria Road constructing direct line with a strong probability they can get up to Rancheria Road within the upcoming days.
 Communities near Shirley Peak experienced increased fire activity that produced lots of smoke from flanking, backing fire and isolated runs. Shirley Meadows also experienced increased fire activity and crews successfully kept the fire south of Old State Road. On Monday, crews and engines will continue working on control lines on Old State Road with the objective of linking in with the spot fire in Alta Sierra.
 On Sunday evening, fire activity in the Shirley Peak area and Alta Sierra had increased and crews were successful in doing a late-night firing operation. That was done to protect Alta Sierra and to keep the fire west of Rancheria Road. Night flying aircraft was utilized to assist with the firing operations and additional night operations around the fire.
