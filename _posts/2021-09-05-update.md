## [French Fire Update – September 5, 2021](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7813/65615/)

{% include common/imgur.html url=page.imgur %}

The French Fire started on Wednesday, August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, and has now burned 26,493 acres with 52 percent containment.  

A National Incident Management Team (NIMO) is managing the fire, integrated with Great Basin IMT 6 and coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management, Sequoia National Forest, and Kern County Fire Department in Unified Command.

- Smoke may be visible today as crews work to complete burnout operations in the Cedar Creek and Alder Creek area using a combination of ground and aerial resources.  Crews are constructing direct handline north of Red Mountain from Bear Creek to Alder Creek
-On the north side of the fire, crews continue to mop up, seeking out and eliminating any remaining heat sources that could threaten the line.  
- The Structure Group is patrolling and mopping up around infrastructure within the fire’s interior, including Alta Sierra, Shirley Meadows, the Shirley Peak communication hub, and the Southern California Edison 66kV sub-transmission lines north of Hwy 155. These crews are also cutting down unsafe (hazard) trees and preparing the areas for residents to return.
- Crews are successfully mopping up to the north from Basket Pass to Evans Meadow which allowed for an increase in containment in this area.  
- The east side of the fire is looking very good. Crews will continue to mop up and patrol.
- Very dry conditions predicted into next week. Light terrain driven winds are expected each day, with westerly winds around 20 mph. Relative humidity will be in the teens during the day and recovery at night will be poor.
