## [French Fire Update – September 3, 2021](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7813/65494/)

{% include common/imgur.html url=page.imgur %}

The French Fire started on Wednesday, August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, has now burned 25,871 acres with 47 percent containment.

Friday, September 3, Great Basin Incident Management Team (IMT) 6 transitioned with California Interagency IMT 12. A National Incident Management Team (NIMO) is managing the fire, integrated with Great Basin IMT 6, and coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management, Sequoia National Forest, and Kern County Fire Department in Unified Command.

On the west side of the fire, crews are evaluating options to go direct on the fire’s edge if safe to do so. The crews are prepping for a defensive low intensity burning operation to remove surface fuels (litter and brush) and improve the effectiveness of the fireline.
