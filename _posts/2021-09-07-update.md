## [French Fire Update – September 7, 2021](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7813/65692/)

{% include common/imgur.html url=page.imgur %}

he French Fire started on Wednesday, August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, and has now burned 26,745 acres with 65 percent containment.

A National Incident Management Team (NIMO) is managing the fire, integrated with Great Basin Incident Management Team 6 and coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management, Sequoia National Forest, and Kern County Fire Department in Unified Command. A transfer of command from the NIMO to Team 6 will occur on Wednesday, September 8.

- Residents are advised to be cautious. Fire engines, water trucks and utility vehicles will be on the roads. Blocking the roads will inhibit personnel from getting work done.
- The Structure Group is patrolling and mopping up around infrastructure within the fire’s interior.
- Crews will work on monitoring and improving the line that was burned out on Sunday, September 5. Crews with the support of aircraft will continue to improve handline north of Red Mountain from Bear Creek to Alder Creek.
- There is minimal fire activity on the north, east, and south sides of the fire. Crews will continue to mop up and patrol the area and remove equipment. Some sections of line near Black Mountain will be monitored from a distance because the area has steep, rocky cliffs and cannot be safely accessed.
- Very dry and warm conditions with low relative humidity will continue. There will be a slight chance of dry thunderstorms Thursday and Friday.
