## [French Fire Update – September 10, 2021](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7813/65932/)

{% include common/imgur.html url=page.imgur %}

The French Fire started on Wednesday, August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, and has burned 26,745 acres with 87 percent containment. Great Basin Incident Management Team 6 manages the fire and is coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management and Sequoia National Forest.

- Portions of the fire area received up to one-half inch of rain Thursday, which will aid with mop-up and containment. There is a continued chance of thunderstorms today. Gusty, erratic winds and possible lightning are expected. Cooler temperatures and slightly higher relative humidity are expected on Saturday.
- The only sections of the fire that remain uncontained are a rugged section around Black Mountain, where crews will monitor the fireline. Crews will continue monitoring, improving, and mopping up the containment line on the fire's western side.
- Firefighters will continue to patrol, mop up and remove equipment around communities and infrastructure within the fire’s interior. Residents are advised to be cautious. Fire engines, water trucks, and utility vehicles will be on the roads.
- Crews are also working at smoothing soil back over bulldozer fuelbreaks and other fireline repairs.
- On Saturday, a local Type 3 team will shadow with the Great Basin Incident Management Team 6 in anticipation of turning over management of the fire on Sunday.

### Fuel Treatments:
Year-round, federal agencies conduct fuels treatments, including removing hazard trees, chipping, and prescribed controlled burns to remove excess fuels that can feed wildland fires near neighboring communities.

### Improve Your Home’s Chance of Survival:
Homeowners can do their part in reducing wildland fire risk by creating Defensible Space, visit [Ready for Wildfire](https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/).

### Fire Closures:
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a [temporary closure](https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/docs/2021-08/EMERGENCY%20CLOSURE%20ORDER%20Keysville.pdf) for the Keysville Special Recreation Management Area to all public access due to wildland fire danger.

### Closure Order of All USDA Region 5 National Forests in California:

### Fire Restrictions:
Public lands managed by the [Sequoia National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd939171.pdf) and the [BLM Bakersfield Field Office](https://www.blm.gov/programs/public-safety-and-fire/fire-and-aviation/regional-info/california/fire-restrictions) are under fire restrictions.
