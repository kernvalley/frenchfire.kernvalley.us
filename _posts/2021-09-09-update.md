## [French Fire Update – September 9, 2021](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7813/65883/)

{% include common/imgur.html url=page.imgur %}

The French Fire started on Wednesday, August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, and has burned 26,745 acres with 76 percent containment. Great Basin Incident Management Team 6 is managing the fire and is coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management and Sequoia National Forest.

- The California Highway Patrol is re-opening Highway 155 today at 9 am, from Wofford Heights to Glennville, due to increased fire containment. Also, the Kernville Airport has re-opened.
- Firefighters will continue to patrol, mop up and remove equipment around communities and infrastructure within the fire’s interior. Residents are advised to be cautious. Fire engines, water trucks, and utility vehicles will be on the roads. Blocking the roads will inhibit personnel from getting work done.
- Crews will continue monitoring, improving, and mopping up the containment line on the fire’s western side. There may be occasional smoke as interior pockets of fuel burn out.
- Some sections of fireline near Black Mountain will be monitored from a distance because the area has steep, rocky cliffs and cannot be safely accessed. Crews are also beginning the process of smoothing soil back over bulldozer fuelbreaks and other fireline repairs.
- Fuel conditions are at record dry levels. Very dry and warm conditions will continue. There will be a chance of dry thunderstorms today and tomorrow. Gusty, erratic winds and possible lightning are expected. Over the coming weekend, cooler temperatures and slightly higher relative humidity are forecasted.
