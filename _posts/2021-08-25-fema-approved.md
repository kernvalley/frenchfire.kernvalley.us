## [Press Release]()
**OAKLAND, Calif.** – The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has authorized the use of federal funds to assist the state of California in combating the French Fire burning in Kern County.

On Aug. 24, the state of California submitted a request for a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) for the French Fire. At the time of the request, the fire threatened approximately 4,000 homes in and around Wofford Heights and Kernville. The fire also threatened dozens of businesses, schools, a fire station, wildfire alert cameras, cell towers, power and transmission lines, and the Alta Sierra water tanks, which provide water to residents and firefighting hydrants in the area.

The FEMA regional administrator approved the state’s request on Aug. 24, as the fire threatened to become a major incident.

FMAGs provide federal funding for up to 75 percent of eligible firefighting costs. The Disaster Relief Fund provides allowances for FMAGs through FEMA to assist in fighting fires that threaten to cause major disasters. Eligible costs covered by FMAGs can include expenses for field camps, equipment use, materials, supplies and mobilization, and demobilization activities attributed to fighting the fire.
