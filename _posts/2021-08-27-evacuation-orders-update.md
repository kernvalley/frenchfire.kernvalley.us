#### SOME Evacuation ORDERS Reduced to Evacuation WARNINGS. Details below.

Este es un mensaje de la seguridad. Para espanol, llame a 2-1-1. Gracias.

UPDATE: As of 3:00 p.m. on Friday, August 27, 2021

This is an update to previous ReadyKern messages concerning the French Fire in the Kern River Valley. SOME Evacuation ORDERS have been reduced to Evacuation WARNINGS. The following information is complete at the time of this message.

The Evacuation ORDERS that affected the communities of Hungry Gulch and Dutch Flat have been reduced to Evacuation WARNINGS. Residents of these communities may return to their residences at this time.

Please note that the area of Hungry Gulch, from Sawmill Road south along Highway 155 to Dutch Flat, remains under an Evacuation WARNING. Residents of these communities are advised that, depending on future French Fire activity, the Evacuation WARNINGS may again be elevated to Evacuation ORDERS with little to no advance notice.

An Evacuation WARNING means that the French Fire is a potential threat to life and/or property, and all residents are advised to be prepared to leave the area at a momentâ€™s notice if it becomes necessary. Those who require additional time to evacuate, and those with pets and livestock, should leave now.

Fire Department staff, vehicles, and equipment remain in the area. Residents should exercise appropriate caution around them.

Residents should remain alert, aware of their surroundings, and prepared to respond appropriately during emergencies. You are encouraged to take action immediately if you feel threatened, even if you have not received another ReadyKern message.

All other previous EVACUATION ORDERS and WARNINGS remain in effect.

Evacuation centers are located at Woodrow Wallace Elementary School, 3240 Erskine Creek Road, Lake Isabella, and Pioneer Elementary School, 1001 Hiett Avenue, Delano. Animal Services will assist with sheltering companion animals at the centers.
