The French Fire started on August 18, and has burned 13, 341 acres with 10% containment west of Lake Isabella in Kern County. The cause of the fire is unknown. The fire is being managed by California Interagency Incident Management Team 12, coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management, Sequoia National Forest, and Kern County Fire Department in Unified Command.

Taking advantage of higher relative humidity last night, crews made an impact utilizing night-flying aircraft on the spot fire north around Alta Sierra and in the southwest region near Woodward Peak. Due to the fire remaining active overnight, additional night-flying aircraft will be available this evening to assist night shift personnel.

Crews and engines continue working on control lines on Old State Road to keep the fire from impacting the Wofford Heights community. Structure protection work remains in Highland, Shirley Meadows, Alta Sierra, Slick Rock, and Dutch Flat communities.

The overall strategy to contain the fire is to continue building containment line from the east end of the fire towards the west into higher elevations. Heavy equipment and hand crews will continue scouting for opportunities to construct back-up contingency containment lines to meet that objective. Aircraft continue to provide water drops on active portions of the fire perimeter, so ground crews can safely enter those areas.

Today, weather conditions will be warm and dry with westerly winds. After the inversion lifts, fire activity is expected to increase, with the forecast calling for low humidity and winds gusting to 20-25 mph. The fire is burning grass, brush and timber, which are at historically dry levels and will likely burn completely, holding heat and actively being consumed throughout the day. Drought conditions, the types of fuels and the weather are causing the fire to run farther and faster.
