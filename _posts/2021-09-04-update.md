## [French Fire Update – September 4, 2021](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/7813/65536/)

{% include common/imgur.html url=page.imgur %}

The French Fire started on Wednesday, August 18, west of Lake Isabella in Kern County, has now burned 25,895 acres with 43 percent containment.

A National Incident Management Team (NIMO) is managing the fire, integrated with Great Basin

IMT 6, and coordinating closely with the Bureau of Land Management, Sequoia National Forest, and Kern County Fire Department in Unified Command.

- Smoke will be more visible today as burnout operations continue from Cedar Creek to Basket Pass Road to improve the effectiveness of the fireline.  Crews continue to evaluate options to go direct on the fire’s edge if safe to do so.
- On the north side of the fire, crews continue to mop up along the fires edge and improve line. Crews are seeking out and eliminating any remaining heat sources that could threaten the line. The Structure Group is patrolling and mopping up around infrastructure within the fire’s interior, including Alta Sierra, Shirley Meadows, the Shirley Peak communication hub, and the Southern California Edison 66kV sub-transmission lines north of Hwy 155. These crews are also cutting down unsafe (hazard) trees.
- On the south side of the fire, crews are mopping up and securing the containment line along Basket Pass Road from north of Basket Pass to Evans Meadow. Crews are working on improving contingency lines in the area.
- The east side of the fire is looking very good. Crews will continue to mop up and patrol and look for any heat that could threaten the line.
- Today will be slightly warmer with relative humidity in the teens and recovery at night will be poor. The winds will be light, 5-10 mph with gusts to 20 mph, and terrain driven. These conditions will continue through Monday.
- We have been asked by the communities how they can help the firefighters. The firefighters are well taken care of. If you would like to help, consider making donations to the Red Cross or your local food bank. We would like to thank everyone for their generosity.
